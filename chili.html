        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is the chili recipe that my grandfather used at his hamburger stand, butchered and changed over the years 
            as my mom learned it from her mother in law. No beans baby, this one is for slopping on burgers and dogs and scooping with chips.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 -3.5lbs Ground Beef</li>
                    <li>1/2 tube of sausage (Jimmy Dean)</li>
                    <li>29oz of tomato sauce (but have some extra on hand)</li>

                    <li>Red Pepper</li>

                </ul>
        </p>

                    <li>Stir often</li>
